# a-beginners-road

As my repository name says, I'm a beginner... with Java.
In school, many many years ago, I studied Basic and Pascal 4. After few years I began getting interested in this new thing that's called "internet" and I began studying techologies related to it and worked with what I learned.

I've worked as a web developer and web designer free-lance few years ago. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP with JScript and working with software like Adobe (then Macromedia) Flash, Fireworks, Dreamweaver but most of all Photoshop. I love meddling with photos and transform them.
It's been a few years now that I left that job but now I want back and I'm determined to focus my interests on Java and on the mobile world.
This doesn't mean that I won't be updating my knowledge of the WWW technologies: I've already begun studying HTML5, CSS3, PHP and dusting off the dirt on my skills with JavaScript... but I really think that I like developing applications better than developing web related content.
With Java, in about 20 days of on and off study, I managed to create a first application with a GUI. It's a very simple dice roller with options for number of sides and number of rolls and maybe I'm a slow learner in this place but I'm quite enthusiast of what I've accomplished in few days, considering that I also have a dayjob... and it's not IT related.

I want to build my skills and add some experiences to my resume so to be able to find a job as a software developer.
My main goal? The Android platform but I won't say "never" about learning something else. There are so many languages and each one of them has interesting characteristics. I already set my eye on Python, for example.

I have a project for an Android app that I want to develop in the months to come and I'm looking forward to realize it.
